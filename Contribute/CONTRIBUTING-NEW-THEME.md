**Contributing to Themes**

We welcome contributions to our theme repository! If you're interested in creating a new theme for our software, please follow these guidelines:

**Before You Start**

1. Read through our [Palette](./Palette/README.md) document to get an understanding of the color palette and design principles we use for our themes.
2. Choose a theme idea or inspiration from our existing themes or come up with your own unique idea.

**Starting the build**
1. Create a new repository based on this [template](https://github.com/BlossomTheme/Template.git)

**Submitting Your Theme**
1. [submit an issue](https://github.com/BlossomTheme/BlossomTheme/issues/new) with a link to your repository. Once the theme is accepted, we will move the repository under the Dracula organization and give you rights to maintain it. Be sure to tag it with `theme-submission` tag.

**Previews**
Please include at least two screenshots of your theme:

* A screenshot of the theme in action, showing how it looks in our software

**Code Style**

We follow the standard code style guidelines for our project. Please make sure to format your code correctly and follow our coding conventions.
